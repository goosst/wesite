# Concept

In the following posts, the different parts of the display are explained in more detail:

- [General concept]({{< relref "homeautomation_epaper_gen.md" >}})
- [Control e-paper with ESP 32]( {{< relref "homeautomation_epaper_ESP.md" >}})
- [Home assistant: content creation]({{<relref "homeautomation_epaper_HASS">}})

All code is available at: [github](https://github.com/goosst/HomeAutomation)



# Remarks and todo

- I should not have bought an ESP32 board including an 18650 battery: this types of batteries is barely available in Europe + if I want it battery operated I can just attach a powerbank, there is more than enough space in the picture frame.
- add description of construction
