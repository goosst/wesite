I wanted a display which:

- does not consume (a lot of) electricity
- is linked with home-assistant, so I can get useful updates pending the moment of the day
- can display interesting photos, when I don't want to know the status of my house / surroundings :)
- doesn't cost an arm and a leg

The result of my tinkering can be seen in the picture above.

I've used two 7.5 inch e-paper displays and incorporated them into a picture frame. The reason for two dislays is mainly because larger e-papers just become very expensive. Obviously you don't need two, if you don't want to... .
