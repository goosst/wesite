      <description>Intro Don&amp;rsquo;t we all want to monitor our home remotely (i.e. when not connected to our local network), turn on the heating on or off if we change our plans, check if everything is going well with our created home automation, etc. Of course we want to do this in a secure way that has limited chance of being hacked.
In this section we&amp;rsquo;ll use tor to access home assistant remotely and connect to it from our mobile phone (through mobile internet).</description>

      <description>Intro This page is mainly to document the steps starting from a fresh linux install and setting up homeassistant and ebusd.
It starts with a fresh install of the debian based crunchbangplusplus, here installed on an (old) laptop with i386 processor. The same method has worked on other debian based systems (tested on armbian running on a singleboard computer). It is assumed the debian based distro is based on debian Buster.</description>
