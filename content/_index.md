Welcome to my website.

This site mainly serves as my own documentation to recreate the things I make and the things I automate using home assistant.
Hopefully this documentation will help others as well.

Code is typically available on [GitHub](https://github.com/goosst), designs on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/goosst?ref=seller-platform-mcnav) and/or [Thinigiverse](https://www.etsy.com/shop/goosst?ref=seller-platform-mcnav)
